This repo will hold scrips to run after a clean Ubuntu installation


We will try to add to the existing script changes made manually today:
software and updates - first tab select everything not selected and change server to main.
in Other Software tab select two first options (canonical partners and canonical partners source code).
in Update tab select all and change security updates to download and install automatically.
in Additional Drivers check for existing drivers not installed and install where found.
