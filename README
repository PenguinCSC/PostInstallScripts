### This repo will hold scrips to run after a clean Ubuntu 16..04 installation

## Goals
The main goal for these scripts is to fully automate an Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop installation. We like to run a single script that will bring the system to our desired state - settings and packages.
The following changes are made manually today, and should be scripted:
* **Software and updates** - _Ubuntu Software_: Change the _Download from_ server to `Main Server`.
* _Other Software_ tab: Check both _Canonical Partners_.
* _Developer Options_ tab: Check  the sole option.
